/*

given-
- integer 
-find no of TRAILING zeroes

clarification-
- what value of int ?
- can int be zero ?
- is factorial value within the limits of int

brute -
calculate the factorial , then put in a string , search from back 

optimized -
calculate no of pairs of 2 &5 
since 2 is abundant , 
count 5 factors
each five cntributes in 1 zero , so find a way to cont all 5 , 25 , 125 , 625  . stop at 625 as 10^4 will not need more than that factors
- since the question limits , we can eailty give answer by dividing n with 4 distinct numbers
but if we scale the inpit , we need a more genralized logarithmic approach
